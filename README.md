classifying the three species of iris identified in Fisher's famous iris dataset using Sci Kit Learn and Keras

Overview

The Iris data set is a database that was originally created by R.A.Fisher and published in 1936 paper called The use of multiple measurments in taxonomic problems. It contains of 3 types of Iris flowers with their multiple collection of 4 attributes: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, presented in centimeters.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines. The Iris dataset gained popularity especially because of illustrating various problems within statistical graphics machine learning and multivariate statistics. It contains 150 observations which makes it small but not trival.
