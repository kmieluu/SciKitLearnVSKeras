## Iris dataset

Iris dataset is famous for being studied and provides a good problem in order to practice on neutral networks since all of the 4 input variables it contains are numeric and have the same scale presented in centimeters. 
Each instance focus on describing the properties of an observed flower sizes and the output variable is specific iris flower species.

The Iris data set is a dataset that was originally created by R.A.Fisher. Published in 1936 paper called "The use of multiple measurments in taxonomic problems". 
It contains of 3 types of Iris flowers with their multiple collection of 4 attributes: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines.

This is a multi-class classification problem which means there are more than two classes to be predicted. Contains. This is an important type of problem on which to practice with neural networks since the three class values require specialized handling.

The iris flower dataset is a well-studied problem and a such it is expected to achieve a model accuracy in the range of 95% to 97%. This provides a good target to aim for when developing our models.


## Sci Kit Learn

Scikit-learn is a Python package that is free to download and has use in machine learning. Featuring multiple algorithms, for example support vector machine, k-neighbours, random forests it also is useful while working in Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.

KNeighborsClassifier implements learning which is based on the **k** nearest neighbors of each query point, where **k** is an integer value specified by the user

## Keras

Keras is a deep learning library that was designed to enable fast experimentation. It uses Python as the primary language. It was built to allow for access to more complex machine learning tasks in a way of removing framework barriers. It is one of the leading high-level neural networks APIs that supports multiple back-end neural network computation engines. 


You can download the iris flowers dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository and place it in your current working directory with the filename “iris.csv“.


# SciKitLearn VS Keras

Keras is a high-level API in Python library for deep learning that wraps the efficient numerical libraries Theano and TensorFlow It is user-friendly but also helps quickly build and test a neural network without much lines of code. Like creating simple or complex neural networks in only few minutes. Modular since everything in Keras can be represented as modules. Scikit Learn is a general machine learning library that was built on top of NumPy. It features a lot of utilities for general pre and post-processing of data. It is a library in Python used to construct traditional models. 

Overview

The Iris data set is a database that was originally created by R.A.Fisher and published in 1936 paper called The use of multiple measurments in taxonomic problems. It contains of 3 types of Iris flowers with their multiple collection of 4 attributes: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, presented in centimeters.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines. The Iris dataset gained popularity especially because of illustrating various problems within statistical graphics machine learning and multivariate statistics. It contains 150 observations which makes it small but not trival.
